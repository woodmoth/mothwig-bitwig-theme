# mothwig-bitwig-theme

Custom theme for Bitwig. *So Retro!*

Main color looks like [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) so in means of versatility accents and some additional colors were taken from there directly.
Also the theme reminds me of Promethium theme for Serum.

Though I altered colors greatly, I tried to keep Bitwig's native color-codes (excluding automations?...).
I also kept light Arranger and Editor versus dark Grid.

Thank you, Berikai!
