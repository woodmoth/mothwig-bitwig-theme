# mothwig-bitwig-theme

Custom theme for Bitwig. *So Retro!*

Main colors look like [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) so in means of versatility accents were taken from there directly.
Also the theme reminds me of Promethium theme for Serum.

Though I altered colors greatly, I tried to keep Bitwig's vanilla color-codes (excluding automations?...).
I also kept light Arranger and Editor versus dark Grid. The contrasts are even greater in Mothwig than in vanilla.

I want MothWig to feel both futuristic and giving retro vibes => *spaseship blue* against *sandy brown*.

Piano-roll has to be, I feel, classy, cosy to write quite detailed scores for a long time without eye strain, while modular synthesis and fx's have to be dark and audacious so you *divide* your production stages.

My number one goal is to make it both usable and stylish, and inspiringly different too and I hope you like it!

Of the Basic branch.
Solarized version still exists and may get rid of Mothwig colours in the future, but the Basic is prioritized.
